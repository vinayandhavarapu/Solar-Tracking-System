Active Solar Trackers Consists of Two Types they are Single Axis Solar Tracker and Double Axis Solar Tracker
Here I am going to demonstrate these two trackers using Arduino Uno

**Single Axis Solar Tracker**

The Solar Panel Tracker is designed to follow the sun movement so that maximum light intensity hits on the solar panel, thus increasing the power efficiency.

In this system, the whole solar panel moves from east to west in a day to point in the direction of the sun. The use of a solar tracker circuit in the field of energy production will increase its efficiency. This system can also be successfully implemented in other solar energy-based projects like water heaters and steam turbines.

Components Required:

Arduino Uno Board

Servo Motor SG90

Resistors 10K – 3 Nos

LDR – 2 Nos

Breadboard

Connecting Wires

5 to 12 Volt power Supply
